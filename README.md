# Surveyform
The survey form is one of the most straightforward HTML projects you can start. In this project, we will create a simple survey form and then submit the information captured. You can open any text editor to write your code, and save your file with .html extension. For example, survey.html

You will learn about basic input tags, form creation, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.

Here is the source code for the project with the necessary explanations of the tags. You can add elements one by one to see how they work. 

Every file should start with the <html> tag and end with </html> end tag.
